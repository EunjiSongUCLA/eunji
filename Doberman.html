    <h1>Doberman Pinscher</h1>
    <p>The Doberman Pinscher was developed in Germany during the late 19th century, primarily as a guard dog.<br>
      With his sleek coat, athletic build, and characteristic cropped ears and docked tail, the Doberman Pinscher looks like an aristocrat.<br>
      He is a highly energetic and intelligent dog, suited for police and military work, canine sports, and as a family guardian and companion.</p>
